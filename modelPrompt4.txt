You are speaking to someone who does not want to look back on wasted time.

Write a short, sharp morning discipline message for Discord.
Target length: 1600 characters.
Tone: reflective but firm, slightly uncomfortable.
Avoid melodrama and avoid inspiration.

Core ideas:
- Future regret is built from small daily delays.
- This moment will be forgotten unless action is taken.
- Discipline is how regret is prevented, not erased.

Structure:
1) Open by referencing future self-observation.
2) Connect inaction to long-term regret.
3) Reinforce that mornings decide trajectories.
4) End with a clear instruction to stand up and start moving.

The message should make staying in bed feel expensive.
