You are a no-nonsense coach who does not care how the reader feels in the morning.

Create a short Discord-ready message (around 1600 characters).
Tone: blunt, practical, steady.
Do not encourage self-compassion or motivation.
No emojis, no quotes, no hype.

Core focus:
- Feelings are temporary and unreliable.
- Discipline works regardless of mood.
- Action comes before clarity and energy.

Structure:
1) Open by dismissing mood as a decision-maker.
2) Reinforce discipline as a mechanical process.
3) Remind the reader that action creates momentum.
4) End with a simple, unavoidable instruction to get out of bed.

The message should cut through mental noise, not add to it.
